relation extraction and similarity findings_____
description of our work___
When an entity spans across multiple words, then POS tags alone are not 
sufficient. We need to parse the dependency tree of the sentence. extracting the 
subject/object along with its modifiers and compound words and also the main 
predicate verb through which these sub and its modifiers are connected are 
plucked and we explored. For extracting the relations and showing in graph we 
have used different techniques also explore a lot of ideas.
Relations between chemicals, genes and disease offer insights into the 
mechanisms behind higher order biochemical phenomena, such as drug-drug 
interactions, drug response and gene-disease associations. We focused on 
extracting relations between chemicals, genes and disease from research articles 
to build a biomedical knowledge graph.
We did make the probability prediction of certain disease occurrence and the 
covid-19 graph and also answering question .We did use prediction in two ways 
with the help of pre-trained BERT MODEL. we did worked with the entities in 2 
order first in a given text order then in a reverse order for probabilities for being 
more correct and we did use sigmoid functions for probability calculation . for 
dataset , we used labeled sentences in Percha B 2018 to classify relations between
entities .
Biomedical graph questions and answers and probability predictions were making 
sense .Like the gene to disease connection that we see in the visualization 
Like what genes are causing coivid-19 we can explore by graph in a minute and
What diseases are linked with covid 19 diseases along with their probability
And what chemicals are responsible for covid -19 disease
Also, if there is any complications for any chemical and side effects all these 
results found.

Shahnila's Contributuion to this___
worked on relation extraction entity extraction  similarity finding  extracting ,coding, exploring theoires thoery related  ideas, building graphs fixing error occuring due to graph and code both and also exploring on different data's and their result  and exploring on data ideas
