 When an entity spans across multiple words, then POS tags alone are not sufficient. We need to parse the dependency tree of the sentence. extracting the subject/object along with its modifiers in a compound form such as animal lover, football player  as a result we will have complete idea about a relation also the relation name how they are connected .
 and will show in graph .this time we will be using  . MultiGraph() instance from a pandas DataFrame using networkx's from_pandas_dataframe which doesnot have local host and server issue hopefully we will be able to implement it .its xactly like neo4j using nodes connection with direction connecting lines 

We will be building an app where any text input can be  given  by user and it will do the following task 
Tokenize the word and show it
Will show the word in lemmatized form
Will pickout  its word  and tell  what this word is sementically 
Will summarize any text by using multiple text  summarization functions(user will have an option to  choose they type they want) 
Will do the  its sentiment analysis
Will give its question answering
Will show similarities among words if possible will  be displayed in graph
