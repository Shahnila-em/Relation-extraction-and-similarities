 When an entity spans across multiple words, then POS tags alone are not sufficient. We need to parse the dependency tree of the sentence. extracting the subject/object along with its modifiers in a compound form such as animal lover, football player  as a result we will have complete idea about a relation also the relation name how they are connected .
 and will show in graph .this time we will be using  . MultiGraph() instance from a pandas DataFrame using networkx's from_pandas_dataframe which doesnot have local host and server issue hopefully we will be able to implement it .its xactly like neo4j using nodes connection with direction connecting lines
